# Drowning Detection with YoloV7 and Grid Tracker

This project aims to detect potential drowning incidents in real-time using YoloV7 and a grid tracking algorithm. 

## Introduction

Drowning is a serious and often overlooked problem. This project aims to provide a solution that can help in detecting and preventing such incidents. 

We use YoloV7, a state-of-the-art object detection system, for detecting people in the water. The grid tracking algorithm is then used to track the movements of these detected objects over time. If the algorithm detects lack of movement or irregular patterns, it raises an alert for potential drowning.

## Features

- Real-time detection and tracking of people in the water
- Utilizes YoloV7 for object detection
- Grid tracking algorithm for movement tracking and pattern recognition
- Alert system for potential drowning incidents
